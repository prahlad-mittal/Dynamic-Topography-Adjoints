# Dynamic-Topography-Adjoints
Inverting for mantle properties using dynamic topography and surface velocity - latest and updated codes. 

This project is a part of my masters thesis project which I am carrying out under the supervision of Dr Sia and Prof Rhodri with the geodynamics group at the Australian National University. 

Find my thesis 'Prahlada-Final-Masters-Thesis.pdf' for detailed understanding and discussion regarding the project. 

Currently, not fully updated. It will be updated with all the codes and results soon.
